# dnd-companion
A small companion app for looking at organized D&D data from https://www.dnd5eapi.co/.

If you are a novice dungeon master who hasn't yet memorized everything in the Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition Players Handbook, this tool is for you! This is handy for looking up information about spells, equipment, conditions, and monsters without thumbing through the book and disrupting the flow of play.

In order to get started, clone this repository. 
Navigate to the `dnd-companion` directory and run:
```
bundle install
```
This will install a small number of gems.

To start the companion app, run:
```
bin/dnd-companion
```
And you're good to go, traveler!
